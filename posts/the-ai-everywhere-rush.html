<h1>the ai everywhere rush: are we missing the point?</h1>
<p><small>Posted November 9, 2025 · Technology</small></p>

<p>you look around right now and it is all artificial intelligence. ai, ai, ai. every single company is sprinting to adopt it, trying to do something with it. this atmosphere feels intense, a high-pressure situation where ai appears to be the only focus.</p>

<p>consider the companies we really trust. the ones that genuinely fulfilled their original commitment to us. they began with a mission to solve a specific, real-world user problem. and they succeeded! achieving that initial goal is a huge victory. of course, a business needs to innovate; that is vital for progress. i fully grasp that. however, i sense something important is being overlooked.</p>

<p>i strongly believe there is absolutely zero necessity to shoehorn artificial intelligence into every single aspect of every product out there.</p>

<h2>the future path: a simple choice</h2>

<p>imagine what the coming days will offer. when you pinpoint a challenge that requires a solution, you will have multiple avenues. expanded and simpler approaches to getting things done.</p>

<p>you will be able to select the traditional, established method that already performs well.</p>

<p>you will be able to select the method that solves the specific problem you identified by utilizing artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>the crucial idea here is that this must remain a choice, a careful decision based entirely on the problem itself. it hinges on whether ai truly improves the solution, making it better, quicker, or easier for the person using it.</p>

<h2>beyond the fear driving decisions</h2>

<p>what seems misguided is the powerful, almost mandatory belief being circulated. the notion that if a company refuses to integrate ai, its entire structure will immediately collapse. that its stock value will drop sharply. this sense of urgency is dictating enormous investment and product development strategies.</p>

<p>true innovation happens when you enhance the primary experience. when you find a superior way to execute the task you are already proficient at. sometimes, that better way involves ai. many times, it involves other improvements. perhaps simplifying the interface. perhaps having highly skilled customer support personnel. perhaps it is merely a quicker, more reliable server.</p>

<p>we should acknowledge and support companies that remain firmly dedicated to addressing the actual user needs they initially committed to solving. their core reason for existence. if ai genuinely aids that core purpose, that is wonderful. if it just adds unnecessary complexity, or if it serves only as a dazzling detail for a press release, then we owe it to ourselves to pause and ask, "what is the real motivation here?"</p>

<p>the problem should always dictate the solution, without exception. ai is a powerful instrument in the toolkit, it is not the only instrument we are compelled to employ.</p>
